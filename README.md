## About me

I (Zachary Wassall) am a graduate student at Northeasten. I am taking this class
concurrently with working at Black Duck Software in Burlington, where I'm a
backend (Java) software developer. I am hoping to become more familiar with the
frontend side of software development. This is a large aspect of development in
which I can currently only fumble around at best.
